# Features
* Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox layout
* Uses custom JavaScript for client-side validation. Error messages are displayed to guide users on how to properly fill out the form.
* Uses regex to define valid patterns for each field.
* Visually indicates whether fields are valid/invalid using green/red borders respectively.
* Validates user input as the user is typing on the fields and also once the user submits the form.
* Mobile-friendly layout (I am still learning about responsive design and this is the first time I've ever applied a media query so there's only one for now for a screen width of below 500px)
